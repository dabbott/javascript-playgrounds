# React Native Web Player
Run react native apps in your browser!

[Try it out!](https://npmcdn.com/react-native-web-player@1.1.0/index.html#title=React%20Native%20Web%20Player)

### Instructions

Include the web player in an iframe.

```html
<iframe width="880" height="425" frameborder="0" src="//npmcdn.com/react-native-web-player@1.1.0/index.html"></iframe>
```

The iframe accepts the following parameters *after the hash* in the url:

- `code` - The code to show/run in the player. Defaults to the sample app.
- `title` - An optional title for the player. By default, there is no title.
- `width` - The width of the device. Defaults to `210`.
- `scale` - Zoom the device screen. Defaults to `1`.
- `platform` - One of `ios` or `android`. Defaults to `ios`. Currently this changes the phone image, but may also have an effect on how the code is executed in the future.
- `assetRoot` - Specifies the root url for asset `require`s. E.g. to require `http://localhost:8080/images/hello.png`, you could set `assetRoot=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2F` and write `require('./images/hello.png')` in your code.
- `vendorComponents` - JSON encoded array of 3rd party components to make available to the sandbox. The format is an array of a 3 part array, with the first being the require name, the second being the global namespace location, and the third being the url. E.g. to load DD.Feed (require name of dd-feed): [[ 'dd-feed', 'DD.Feed', 'http://vendor-url/scripts/dd.feed.js']]

The easiest way to set the `code` parameter is to edit the code in the web player and copy and paste the url when you're done (the url updates automatically as you type).

Alternately, you can manually url-encode the parameters. You can do so via the JavaScript console.
```JavaScript
encodeURIComponent('Hello World')
# => "Hello%20World"
```

### Hosting

This project contains static assets that run standalone in the browser. You don't need a server, unless you want to host the assets yourself.

##### npmcdn

The example URLs on this page use npmcdn.

```html
<iframe width="880" height="425" frameborder="0" src="//npmcdn.com/react-native-web-player@1.1.0/index.html"></iframe>
```

##### MaxCDN

Another hosting option is rawgit + MaxCDN. You may find this option more performant. It also serves over `http` instead of just `https`, if you don't want to serve mixed content.

```html
<iframe width="880" height="425" frameborder="0" src="//cdn.rawgit.com/dabbott/react-native-web-player/v1.1.0/index.html"></iframe>
```

##### gh-pages

If you prefer, you may access the gh-pages branch directly. This has the advantage of always serving you the latest version, but the drawback of potentially failing on major API changes (along with slower download speeds for the assets).

```html
<iframe width="880" height="425" frameborder="0" src="//dabbott.github.io/react-native-web-player/"></iframe>
```
